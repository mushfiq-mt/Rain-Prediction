# Rain Prediction in Austalia
Developed a binary classification model to predict tomorrow's rain using Python's capabilities. Conducted data collection, pre-processing, and feature engineering to optimize dataset. Evaluated model performance through rigorous analysis and utilized insights for predictive accuracy.

# 1.Overview of the process
We are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using various evaluation metrics.
We will use these algorithms:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, we will use models to generate the report displaying the accuracy scores.

# 2.Data Gathering
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.
The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData
